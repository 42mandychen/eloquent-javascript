# Programming Basics in JavaScript

## Expression vs Statement

An expression produces a value, while a statement performs an action.

> Wherever JavaScript expects a statement, you can also write an expression. Such a statement is called an *expression statement*. The reverse does not hold: you cannot write a statement where JavaScript expects an expression.

## `var`, `let`, `const`

To declare a variable, we have `var`, we have `let`, and we have `const`… Which one to use?

Well, the easiest one is `const` — when you use `const`, you are saying that the variable will not be reassigned.

What about `let` and `var`?

## `==` vs. `===`

`==` does type conversion silently when the types of both sides are not the same, `===` doesn't do type conversion. In other words, `==` checks equality, while `===` checks identity.

> The rules for converting strings and numbers to Boolean values state that `0`, `NaN`, and the empty string (`""`) count as `false`, while all the other values count as `true`.

The take-home message is, if you want to check if two things have the same type and have the same value, use `===`, as `==` may have unexpected behaviours.

However, one thing probably needs to be brought up: you can't use `==` or `===` to check if two objects are equal.  For example:

```javascript
let a = [1,2,3];
let b = [1,2,3];
console.log(a == b);  // -> false
console.log(a === b); // -> false
```

To see more detailed documentations regarding `==` and `===`, check [The Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm](http://es5.github.io/#x11.9.3).

## `undefined` vs. `null`

>  The difference in meaning between `undefined` and `null` is an accident of JavaScript’s design, and it doesn’t matter most of the time. In the cases where you actually have to concern yourself with these values, I recommend treating them as interchangeable (more on that in a moment).

## Lexical Scoping



## ES6 Arrow Functions

Why do we need arrow functions?

An arrow function is basically a lambda function [1], and a lambda function does ***not*** create a scope [2]. 

Remember the annoying thing to keep in mind — `let that = this`? You do not need to do it if you use an arrow function.

Let's look at some code in React [3] (modified from my project .

```javascript
function someFunction () {
  jsonp(requestURL, null, (error, data) => {
        if (error) {
          console.log('error!');
          console.error(error.message);
          this.setState({error: error.message});
        } else {
          console.log('success!');
          console.log(data);
          this.setState({media_id: data.media_id});
        }
      });
}
```

The above code interacts with Intagram API to get the `media_id` of an Instagram post (photo or video). In this version, we can see the callback function is an arrow function. Inside the arrow function, `this.setState({error: error.message});` can be called because `this` inside the arrow function is the same as outside the `jsonp` call.

What if we don't use this arrow function, i.e., let's say we are using ES5 [4] instead of ES6 [5]?

```javascript
function someFunction () {
  let that = this;
  jsonp(requestURL, null, function (error, data) {
        if (error) {
          console.log('error!');
          console.error(error.message);
          that.setState({error: error.message});
        } else {
          console.log('success!');
          console.log(data);
          that.setState({media_id: data.media_id});
        }
      });
}
```

In this case, we have to set `that` to be `this` so that inside the callback function — which creates a scope of its own — we still have access to `this` — the function scope of `someFunction`.
