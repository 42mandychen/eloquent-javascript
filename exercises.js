/* 2. Program Structure */

/*Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

var abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// → 3
Most exercises contain a piece of code that you can modify to solve the exercise. Remember that you can click code blocks to edit them.*/

for (var line = "#"; line.length < 8; line += "#") {
  console.log(line);
}

/*Chess board

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
*/

var size = 8;

var board = "";

for (var y = 0; y < size; y++) {
  for (var x = 0; x < size; x++) {
    if ((x + y) % 2 == 0) {
      board += " ";
    } else {
      board += "#";
    }
  }
  board += "\n";
}

console.log(board);
